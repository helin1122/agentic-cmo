## Style Rules

*Based on [Google Technical Writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)*

### Words & Terminology
- Define new or unfamiliar terms; collect multiple new terms into a glossary
- Use the same unambiguous word or term consistently — never rename concepts mid-document
- For long names, introduce a shortened version upfront (e.g., **Term Name** (**TN**)), then use only the acronym
- Only define acronyms that are significantly shorter than the full term and used multiple times
- Place pronouns within 5 words of their referent; otherwise repeat the noun
- Replace vague "this" or "that" with explicit nouns (e.g., "this variable" not just "this")

### Active Voice
- Use active voice for the vast majority of sentences: **actor + verb + target**
- Passive voice ("target + verb + actor") should be rare and intentional
- Look for forms of "be" + past participle as passive markers (e.g., "was generated", "is interpreted")
- Imperative sentences (commands) count as active voice — prefer them for instructions

### Clear Sentences
- Choose strong, precise verbs over weak ones (avoid generic forms of "be", "occur", "happen")
- Reduce "There is" / "There are" openings — reposition the true subject earlier
- Replace vague adjectives and adverbs with objective data (e.g., "225% faster" not "extremely fast")
- Feed readers factual data, not marketing speak

### Short Sentences
- Focus each sentence on a single idea, thought, or concept
- Convert long sentences with conjunctions ("or", "and") into bulleted or numbered lists
- Eliminate filler phrases:
  - "at this point in time" → "now"
  - "determine the location of" → "find"
  - "is able to" → "can"
  - "causes the triggering of" → "triggers"
- Limit subordinate clauses (which, that, because, whose, until, unless, since) — split into separate sentences when they introduce a new idea
- Use "that" for essential clauses (no comma); use "which" for nonessential clauses (preceded by comma)

### Lists & Tables
- Use **bulleted lists** for unordered items; **numbered lists** for sequential steps
- Avoid embedding lists inside sentences — break them out
- Maintain parallel structure across all list items (grammar, capitalization, punctuation)
- Start numbered list items with imperative verbs
- Introduce every list and table with a sentence ending in a colon
- Keep table cells concise (no more than two sentences per cell)
- Label columns with meaningful headers

### Paragraphs
- Make the opening sentence the most important — it establishes the paragraph's theme
- Restrict each paragraph to a single topic
- Aim for 3–5 sentences per paragraph; avoid walls of text (7+ sentences)
- Answer three questions: **What** are you communicating? **Why** does it matter? **How** should the reader use it?

### Audience
- Define your target audience by role and proximity to the knowledge
- Provide only the information the audience lacks: `needed knowledge − current knowledge`
- Avoid the curse of knowledge — don't assume readers share your expertise
- Match vocabulary complexity to audience level; explain unfamiliar terms
- Maintain cultural neutrality — avoid idioms, sports metaphors, and culturally specific references
- Write for international comprehension with simple, clear English

### Document Structure
- State the document's scope (what it covers) and non-scope (what it does not) upfront
- Specify the target audience and prerequisites at the start
- Lead with key points — answer the reader's essential questions on page one
- Relate new concepts to technologies and concepts the audience already understands
- Break long topics into focused sections with clear headings
